"""The Delta: what THIS clone's own commits changed, and whether any of it is engine code.

FR-007: the delta is the diff from the MERGE BASE with main to HEAD (research R1) - equivalently
`git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`. A sync-in that merged main moves the merge base forward
to main's tip, so what main contributed drops out by construction; no per-commit filtering of merge
commits is needed, and a hand-made merge commit's content is main's and disappears the same way.

FR-008: `ENGINE` below is THE ONE LIST of paths whose change requires the paid gate. It governs
DISPATCH only - it must never narrow what `scripts/gate-stamp.py` hashes (that guard has its own
list and its own reasons). Documentation, design notes, research, the append-only logs and a pool
map's `.notes.md` are not engine code even inside the skill; the GM: *"even if the diagram
documentation was touched, but not the code itself, then we should not rerun the tests."*
`tests/ci/test_delta.py` walks every path KIND and pins its classification, so a new kind of file
cannot be silently either.
