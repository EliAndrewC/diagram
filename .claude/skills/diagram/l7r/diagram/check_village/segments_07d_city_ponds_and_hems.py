"""Town, city and capital segments moved out of `segments_07b_ponds_hems_and_land_fall.py` by feature 145.

The GM ruled on 2026-08-28 that the hamlet path owes 100% coverage and the other tiers owe none while
nothing exercises them - and the floor is MODULE level, so a city segment sharing a file with a hamlet
segment put its whole body under the hamlet floor. Execution order is by the segment's numeric key
(`registry._ordered_names`), never by file, so moving one costs nothing and needs no placement row."""
