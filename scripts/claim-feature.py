"""Claim the next spec-kit feature number under a host-wide lock - `make claim SLUG=<slug>` (feature 197).

WHY (GM 2026-09-07): *"I believe that I have noticed there being times when two different sessions
each end up claiming the same spec kit feature number, and then this causes problems later when one
clone needs to go back and update their feature to use a different number ... we could have a makefile
target that selects the next feature number ... using some file locking or other kind of multiprocess
locking just to make sure that we always grab the next available feature number."*

Measured before this existed (specs/197/research.md R2): fourteen numbers were claimed by two features
at some point, eight renumber commits landed between 2026-08-29 and 2026-09-06, one feature renumbered
twice, and main still carries two features numbered 195. The old protocol read main's `specs/` after
`sync-in` and let the PUSH surface a collision - hours or days after both sessions had built on the
same number. Its blind spot was structural: a sibling session's claim lives in
`<mirror>/.clones/<other>/specs/` until that session pushes, and nothing read that directory.

WHAT "NEXT AVAILABLE" MEANS. A number is taken when any of these holds it, all read UNDER THE LOCK:
  1. the mirror's working tree `specs/`               (main as this container last saw it)
  2. the mirror's `origin/main` tree (`git ls-tree`)  (fetched but not yet fast-forwarded; no network)
  3. every clone's `specs/` under `<mirror>/.clones/` (the other sessions' UNPUSHED claims)
  4. the ledger of every claim this tool has made
Next = 1 + the maximum. THE CLAIM IS THE DIRECTORY: `specs/NNN-slug/` is created in the caller's clone
before the lock is released, so the next caller's scan (source 3) sees it.

WHERE THE STATE LIVES, AND WHY IT NEEDS NO REGENERATING. The lock and the ledger sit under the
mirror's `.specify/` - the mirror root is the host volume, so both survive a container rebuild, and
both are gitignored (`*.lock` already was; the ledger has its own line). The ledger is a RECORD and a
safety net, never the only source: sources 1-3 alone give the right next number in every case but one -
a number claimed and then abandoned (its directory deleted before any push) is held only by the
ledger, and with the ledger gone it is reused. That is harmless (a number that never reached main
identifies nothing) and is stated here so nobody "fixes" it with a counter file, which WOULD need
regenerating (spec D1/D2).

The lock is `fcntl.flock` on a file - the same lock `flock(1)` takes, so a shell that ever holds
`flock` on the same path serializes with this too. No fetch happens under it: `sync-in` fetches GitHub
main at every prompt, so source 2 is at most one turn old; a spec pushed from the GM's laptop inside
that turn is the one residual window, and the old "renumber the unpushed spec" rule is kept for exactly
that case (spec D4).

    claim-feature.py <slug> [--dry-run] [--root DIR] [--main DIR] [--lock-timeout S]
    claim-feature.py --renumber specs/NNN-slug [--dry-run ...]     (move an existing directory to the next number)

Refusals (exit 2, nothing created, nothing appended): run from the mirror itself (main is never a
workspace); a slug that is not lower-case kebab; a slug already in use anywhere the scan reads; the
lock not acquired within the timeout (a held lock is a hung process, not a queue - the refusal names
the file). A number held by two directories in main is REPORTED on every claim and never renumbered
by a claim - renumbering a landed feature is the GM's call (spec D3). When the GM makes it, `--renumber`
(`make claim RENUMBER=specs/NNN-slug`) performs the move under the same lock: that is how the 195
duplicate was resolved on 2026-09-07 (`195-target-descriptions-and-two-removals` -> 198, the one with
fewer references to its number).
