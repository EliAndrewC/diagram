# Brief - feature 269 (the research backfill), group X1B: towns, buildings and capitals (part b), session 1: research and write

You are a FRESH session for one part of feature 269. This brief is the whole of what you need; do not read the
feature's spec or plan to orient - everything you read stays in your context and is paid for again on every later
turn. Work in this clone (`/diagram/.clones/diagram-supplemental`); the project's CLAUDE.md files apply to you, the research record's
`CLAUDE.md` above all (it auto-loads when you read a research file).

**Read narrowly.** For a few notes of a question use `make notes PAGE=<page> SECTION=<NNN> KEYS=<key,key>` (in
`.claude/skills/diagram`). Grep with `-o` and a short context. Send the lookups you know you need in one message.
**Do not edit these sections - other sessions own them:** feature 265: buildings 010, 070, 150, 170, 210;
cities/river-cities 010-040; urban-features 010, 012, 020, 030, 050, 060, 070, 080, 160; ways 020; towns 040, 080,
090, 100, 130; cities/capitals 040, 150, 155, 330-336. Feature 267: buildings 240-640, vegetation 170-200,
religion-and-death 220-260, fields 220-240. Feature 268: religion-and-death 080-126. Where a finding OWES one of those
a correction, say exactly what in the handoff; the orchestrator sends it to the owner.
**New registry entries and glossary terms take their prefix from `make reserve KIND=registry|glossary KEY=<k>`** (in
`.claude/skills/diagram`); a write session's eleventh registry key is refused - then follow its message (write the
unreached items to `$L7R_CONTINUE` as a brief of this same shape, commit, stop).
**Coordination files are read by line, never whole** (feature 274): `make lines FILE=<f> KEY=<regex>` and
`make append FILE=<f> LINE="<text>"`. **Claims first (FR-011):** `make lines FILE=/diagram/.clones/RESEARCH-CLAIMS.md
KEY="<each page your items name>"`; skip any item another session has claimed since, naming it in the handoff; then
`make append FILE=/diagram/.clones/RESEARCH-CLAIMS.md LINE="Diagram supplemental | 269 | group X1B in progress | <date>"`.
Read only your own lines of a handoff (`make lines FILE=<handoff> KEY="SECTION=<yours>|KEY=<yours>"`), and add to a
checks report with `make append`.

## Your items (from `specs/269-research-backfill/inventory.md`, group X1B)

Each is a research QUESTION the record owes: never researched, labeled a guess, or thinly sourced. The kinds named are
the map features whose write-ups will be rewritten from what you find (by the orchestrating session, NOT by you).

- B44 The magistrate's manor drawn as a plain walled box (`towns/110`) and poverty texture (`buildings/110`). S.
- B45 Scorpion against Crane capital (`cities/capitals/380`, canon first by `make canon`) and which provincial rules
  invert in a capital (`cities/capitals/390`). M.

## The procedure (session 1: research and write)

1. **Canon first, once.** An item that is a question of the SETTING is answered from the GM's canon with ONE call
   naming every term: `make canon TERMS="<a>|<b>|<c>"` (in `.claude/skills/diagram`). Most items here are history.
2. **Find and save the pages.** Search (Japanese sources first for Edo villages and castle towns - jawiki, kotobank,
   a prefecture's or city's page, J-STAGE open papers, a museum's page; Chinese for Chinese practice). Save every
   candidate with `make source-pages OUT=/tmp/l7r-check/269-x1b-pages URLS="<u1> <u2> ..."` (one directory for the
   group; a second call adds to it) and grep them yourself - a page over 20,000 characters is saved in PARTS, so a
   grep hit leads to one bounded read. A source already in the registry reaches `source-reader` as
   `make check-bundle KEY=<key> WHOLE=1` (the plain `KEY=` bundle is an excerpt for `source-applicability` only).
3. **Read through `source-reader`.** Dispatch ONE `source-reader` over every claim at once, handing it the saved
   directory and each claim verbatim in the prompt - never a path under `/diagram` (`check-bundle-hooks.sh` refuses
   that). Write only from what it returns READ with a quote.
4. **Decide each item's outcome** from what was read: ACCURATE (the record now says it, cited), KNOB (two or more
   forms attested - name each, each cited; the map rolls among them per settlement), SILENT (nothing readable says it -
   an ABSENCE note with what was searched and when; the claim stays a labeled guess), or CONTRADICTION-RESOLVED (an
   existing section was wrong - say which and what corrects it). A search that finds nothing is an outcome, not a
   failure: record it and move on. A degree along a continuum is calibrated liberty; distinct forms are a knob.
5. **Write** on the existing sections the items name. A new question is a fragment `research/<page>/NNN-<heading id>.html` at a free prefix in
   your range, opening with `<h2 id="...">` whose text is the question a reader would ask from the map; a
   `<p><strong>Sources:</strong> ...</p>` roster; the finding; and where it drives what a map draws, the decision in
   plain words. A THIN-SECTION item is answered in the section that makes the claim: every real-world assertion there
   ends cited, with an absence note, or labeled a guess. Footnotes: `<sup class="fn" data-note="<key>"></sup>` in the
   prose, `<li data-note="<key>">...</li>` in the `.notes.html` beside it - every note a CITATION (quoted, translated
   and marked as such, the original after), an ABSENCE note, or a GROUNDS note, by the record's rules. A new key gets
   its registry entry (reserved as above), shaped as `9340-bungotakada-tagoshi.html` is (both write-ups). A source
   only the GM can fetch goes at the END of `/host-l7r-repo/academic-sources/TO-DOWNLOAD.md` in its format. First
   `Read` every file you will change ALL IN ONE MESSAGE, then `Edit`/`Write` - never script an edit. Then in
   `.claude/skills/diagram`: `make record && make citations && make test-file FILE="tests/interactive/test_footnotes.py
   tests/interactive/test_citations.py tests/interactive/test_sources.py tests/interactive/test_record_format.py"`, and
   `python3 scripts/check-question-size.py` from the clone root (a question and its notes stay under 20,000 bytes -
   split one along its topics).
6. **Hand off.** Write `specs/269-research-backfill/briefs/x1b-handoff.md`: one line per new or changed question as
   `- SECTION=<page>/<NNN>` (e.g. `- SECTION=homesteads/250`), one per new registry key as `- KEY=<key>`, and one line
   per item: `B<nn> <OUTCOME> - <one sentence of what the record now says> - <what it means for the kinds and maps
   named: what the generator should draw differently, if anything>`. Then anything left open and why. Commit (a
   message beginning `269 X1B:`). Do NOT run the record checks, do NOT push - the check sessions do that in fresh
   contexts. Your last message is one paragraph saying what you wrote.
